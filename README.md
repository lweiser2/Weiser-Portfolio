# Lauren's Advanced GIS Portfolio

## About Me
### I am a second year Master's student studying Public Policy and Management! I have two cats and I recently got back into weight-lifting during my free time. I also like to play video games and read books. Fun fact: I'm colorblind, so my maps may look at bit wonky style-wise.

## What I hope to learn
### I want to learn how to make visually appealing maps that people will actually want to use. Most of my prior knowledge of GIS is about the data side, which is very useful but I would love to know more about how it's used in the real world!
